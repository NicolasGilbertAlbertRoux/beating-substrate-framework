BSF Stage 59 — magnetism: Lorentz force & cyclotron motion from the substrate's phase-flow vorticity.
A vortex carries A = (Gamma/2pi) grad(phi) (S49); B = curl A = the substrate vorticity (the phase
circulation IS the magnetic flux: measured circulation = Gamma exactly). A charge minimally coupled to A
feels F = q v x B: cyclotron motion with r = mv/qB and omega = qB/m (verified), |v| conserved (force does
no work, F.v ~ 1e-17), closed orbit; a static charge feels no magnetic force. With the Coulomb/electric
sector (S25), this is the magnetic half of electromagnetism, built from ingredients ALREADY present in the
substrate (vortices, phase flow) -- the most "free" of the two fronts.
HONEST RESERVE: standard minimal coupling / hydrodynamic analogy (magnetism ~ vorticity), established. We
obtain the FORCE law; full Maxwell dynamics (displacement current, the photon as the propagating gauge
field) is more -- though the Goldstone/phase (S27) is the natural gauge-field candidate. A real incremental
link completing the EM force sector, not the full Maxwell theory.
