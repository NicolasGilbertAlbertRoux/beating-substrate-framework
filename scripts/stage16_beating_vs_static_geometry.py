BSF Stage 16 — DISTINCTIVENESS: does a BEATING core produce different ARCHITECTURE than a
STATIC soft core? (the content discriminator -- regular polyhedra are generic to attraction+
core; only a BEATING-vs-STATIC difference would be distinctive to the author's substrate.)

For each N: relax from random init with (a) STATIC repulsion (fixed R0) and (b) BEATING
repulsion (R(t)=R0(1+A sin omega t), fast beat so positions feel the time-averaged effect).
Compare the resulting ARCHITECTURE (scale-invariant): mean coordination number, NN-distance
regularity CV, and the normalized pairwise-distance pattern.

PRE-REGISTERED: if beating coordination/geometry == static for all N -> GENERIC (beating adds
nothing to architecture; its content is stability, not shape). If they DIFFER for some N ->
DISTINCTIVE (a real beating-specific architecture). Honest: 3D toy, functional, not nature.

RESULT + DECISIVE FOLLOW-UP: first glance showed beating coord/regularity DIFFERENT from
static for N=6,8,12 (beating more regular, higher coord; static CV high 0.42-1.10). BUT a
turn-off-the-beat test (relax the beating structure with a STATIC core) showed N=6,8 STAY
identical (coord 4.00->4.00, 4.75->4.75, CV unchanged; only a rescaling drift) => those
architectures ARE static equilibria, the beat merely HELPED REACH them. Static relaxation
from a good start disperses the cluster (coord 1.5-2.5) => the high static CV was a FAILED
RELAXATION, not the true static geometry. VERDICT: the apparent distinctiveness is largely a
RELAXATION ARTIFACT -- beating does not select distinctive architecture, it ANNEALS better.
N=12 inconclusive (collapses without beat, but static relaxation too unreliable to attribute).
Honest positive: beating acts as an integrated annealer (reaches order from random where static
freezes) -- a dynamical/functional capacity, consistent with the meta-pattern (beating content
is process, not static geometry), though any oscillation/noise also anneals (not unique).
