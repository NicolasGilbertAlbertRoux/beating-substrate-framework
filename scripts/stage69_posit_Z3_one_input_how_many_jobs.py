BSF Stage 69 (user: posit Z3 as a discovered substrate resistance) - one input, how many jobs?
(1) CONSISTENCY: Z3 = 3-fold phase/triality = the 3-state Potts/clock critical theory (c=4/5, exactly
    solvable), sits inside the critical substrate (S31/S55) without breaking anything. Positing it buys the
    gauge 3-ness exactly as the SM posits its gauge group -> legitimate input, parity with the SM. OK to posit.
(2) OVER-DETERMINATION #1 (Dirac 3+1 build): the minimal spinor dim 2^(d/2)=4 is fixed by SPACETIME (Clifford,
    S56), not by internal color; a Dirac fermion exists with no color. Z3 (internal) does NOT touch the
    emergent 4-spinor field dynamics (Lorentz sector). ORTHOGONAL - null #1 holds.
(3) OVER-DETERMINATION #2 (GW at c): speed-spin tradeoff with stable moduli - the conservative BEAT is at the
    longitudinal cone speed but HELICITY 0 (scalar); the elastic SHEAR is HELICITY 2 but c_T<c_L strictly
    (S57). spin-2 AT c needs a mode that is both; the retroactive counter-beat is amplitude/phase feedback and
    does not change mu (so cannot lift c_T). Still needs the posited Kleinert helicity-2 field. ORTHOGONAL -
    null #2 holds.
VERDICT: posit Z3 freely (consistent, harmless, gauge 3-ness, SM parity) - DO IT; but NO over-determination:
the three walls are orthogonal structures (color/internal, spinor/spacetime, spin-2-at-c/elastic-vs-curvature).
One posit = one job. With Z3 posited the GAUGE sector is at SM parity; remaining open = Dirac-3+1 build
(Lorentz/spinor, constructive) + GW-at-c (Kleinert helicity-2 field) + three generations (still not forced).
Clean separated map. The action/feedback = beat/counter-beat is real but amplitude/phase only.
