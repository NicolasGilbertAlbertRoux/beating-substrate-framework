"""
BSF Stage 58 — Kleinert curvature sector: gamma=1 / full Einstein (CONDITIONAL, an added field).
A spin-2 curvature field DECOUPLED from elastic c_T (so it can travel at c, escaping the S57 stability
bound), with the trace-reversed coupling box h_mn = -16piG (T_mn - 1/2 eta_mn T). For a static mass the
trace-reversed source has S_00 = S_11 = S_22 = S_33 = rho/2 (all EQUAL) -> spatial curvature equals temporal
-> gamma = 1 -> full Einstein light bending (factor 1+gamma = 2 = 4GM/bc^2), vs a scalar (gamma=0, half).
Being light-speed, Weinberg-Deser then forces universal coupling => a genuine graviton.
HONEST RESERVE: standard linearized GR + Kleinert's defect-curvature identification (established). It is an
ADDED sector beyond the minimal substrate -> status CONDITIONAL: "Einstein gravity emerges IF the Kleinert
curvature field is adjoined", NOT forced by the elastic substrate alone. S57 explains exactly why it must be
added (the elastic spin-2 mode is sub-luminal in any stable medium).
