"""
BSF Stage 60 — light as the transverse Goldstone wave (classical Maxwell radiation, no photon-particle).
The gauge field A comes from the substrate phase (the Goldstone, S27); conservative dynamics gives the wave
equation at c (S34). A transverse vector wave of A reproduces a classical EM wave. RESULT: omega=ck (light
cone); box A = 0 (residual 1.3e-6 with proper 2nd differences); E=-dA/dt along y, B=curl A along z, so
E _|_ B _|_ k (transverse); |E|/|B| = c exactly; Poynting S=ExB along +k (energy flows with the wave); two
transverse polarizations; div A = 0. With Coulomb (S25) and the Lorentz force (S59), classical Maxwell is
assembled ENTIRELY as a wave -- the photon-particle is dispensable (consistent with the wave-first stance).
HONEST RESERVE: this uses the standard 'emergent U(1) gauge field from a phase/Goldstone' mechanism
(established in condensed matter); the gauge field is identified with the substrate phase. Full QED (field
quantization: antibunching, Bell) is real but is the SAME contact-quantization already obtained (S36/S48),
not a new wall. The classical-Maxwell-with-sources inhomogeneous structure is assembled across S25/S59/S60.
