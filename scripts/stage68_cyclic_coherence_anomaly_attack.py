BSF Stage 68 (user: attack the cyclic-coherence / anomaly angle) - does self-consistency FIX the tongue?
The retroactive counter-beat closes the loop on its OWN detuning: Omega = Omega0 + g*w, w = winding(Omega),
solved self-consistently so the detuning is no longer free. Which Arnold tongue does it self-select?
RESULT (pre-registered null HELD): self-consistency does remove the detuning freedom (closure works, kept),
but it self-selects the DOMINANT/widest tongues - 0/1, 1/1, 1/2 (g=0.25: 1/1 6/19, 0/1 4/19, 1/2 2/19;
g=0.5: 0/1 8/19, 1/1 3/19, 1/2 2/19, 1/3 only 1/19 = noise). NEVER robustly 1/3. The anomaly-style sum rule
Sum(w_i)=1 distributes windings but leaves the sector COUNT N as an input (1/N for any N). => cyclic closure
forces the SIMPLEST ratio; the number 3 is specifically BEYOND simple closure. No independent second
prediction emerged. ALL our forcing mechanisms (minimality->2, self-similarity->unconstrained, cyclic
closure->1 or 2) land on 1 or 2, never 3: '3 is not the simplest fixed point of anything'. In real physics
the colour 3 is protected by the Z3 centre of SU(3) (triality) - a SYMMETRY protection, not self-consistency.
So colour SU(3)/Z3 must be POSITED, not derived. The counter-beat is a real methodological gain (stabilising
feedback + a forcing mechanism, kept); it sharpens the wall ('3 is not simplest') without breaching it.
