"""
BSF Stage 54 — spin-2 mode from the elastic/shear sector (the graviton half of the 3D-rotation wall).
The strain tensor (symmetric rank-2) splits into trace (spin-0 = compression = longitudinal sound) +
traceless symmetric (spin-2 = shear = transverse phonon). Spin-2 <=> the traceless part transforms with
helicity +/-2 under rotation: s=(e_xx-e_yy)/2 + i*e_xy -> e^{2i*phi} s.
RESULT: trace INVARIANT (spin-0); traceless s rotates EXACTLY as e^{2i*phi} (helicity 2 = SPIN-2), residual
~1e-16. The transverse phonon (S43, c_T=0.48>0) lives in this sector and PROPAGATES -> the substrate's
crystal sector carries a propagating spin-2 mode, the graviton prerequisite a pure superfluid lacked (S46).
HONEST RESERVE: Kleinert elasticity<->gravity (established). STILL posited: the universal trace-reversed
coupling to mass that promotes this spin-2 phonon to THE graviton (the Einstein-equation structure). The
OTHER half of the wall -- the spin-1/2 spinor double-cover (4pi) -- is NOT given by classical elasticity
(integer spins only); 2D came via flux attachment (S49), but the 3+1 Dirac spinor double-cover stays the
hard residue. Wall entered from both sides, closed from neither.
