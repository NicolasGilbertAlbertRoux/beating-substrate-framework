BSF Stage 61 (lead 1) — latent origin of mass and Lambda: linked, but opposite spectral moments.
Both the particle mass (latent dressing / self-energy) and Lambda (latent gravitating vacuum) come from the
SAME latent spectral density J(Omega). Pre-registered test of whether the link FIXES the Lambda magnitude.
RESULT: mass shift dm^2 = integral J/Omega^2 ~ log(Lc) (IR-dominated, set by LOW latent modes); vacuum energy
~ integral J*Omega ~ Lc^3 (UV-dominated, set by HIGH latent modes). They are OPPOSITE spectral moments. So
mass and Lambda DO share one latent origin (a genuine conceptual unification: two faces of the latent zero-
point energy), but knowing the mass scale (IR) does NOT fix Lambda (UV) -> the magnitude is not transferred.
PRE-REGISTERED RESULT: NULL on "solving the Lambda magnitude". The link is real in ORIGIN, but opposite
moments -> the cosmological-constant magnitude stays open (as for everyone). HONEST: mass renormalization
and vacuum energy being the same vacuum fluctuations is standard QFT; the substrate adds the unified latent
picture, NOT a solution. The user's idea was right about the unification, not about a magnitude solution.
