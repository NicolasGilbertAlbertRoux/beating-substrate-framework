"""
BSF Stage 66 (user: do all three) - three PRE-REGISTERED probes toward internal structure, with the null
expected and reported for each.
(A) MINIMAL CLOSURE: smallest structure admitting a 2-dim spinor (double cover) = SU(2); adding chirality
    (complex reps) needs U(1) or SU(N>=3) -> minimality reaches SU(2)xU(1) (electroweak SIZE). Color N and
    the number of generations are FREE (SU(2)<SU(3); nothing forces replication). PRE-REG NULL HOLDS.
(B) LIM (Latent Information Mechanics): entanglement entropy of a critical free-fermion chain (correlation-
    matrix method) -> S=(c/3)ln l + const, fitted c=1.000 (exact free-boson/superfluid value). LIM information
    = forced central charge / area-law, holographic-consistent (S64). c~1, NOT 3. PRE-REG NULL HOLDS.
(C) FRACTALS tuned to ALL our modes (eta=1/4, jump 2/pi, 1/2, G_eff,...): Hausdorff d=lnN/ln(1/r). Branch
    number N is FREE, dims are generic reals; no construction forces d=3 or N=3. One entry lands at 3.07 only
    because N=4 was CHOSEN - the numerology trap, NOT a signal. PRE-REG NULL HOLDS (honestly, it was nothing).
VERDICT: all three nulls hold. Real & forced: minimal chiral-spinor SIZE (SU(2)xU(1)); LIM info = forced
central charge / area law. NOT forced: color SU(3), three generations, a fractal '3'. The gain is a MAP of
exactly where minimality and self-similar information reach and where they stop. SM numbers = still the wall.
