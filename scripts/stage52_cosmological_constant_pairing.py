"""
BSF Stage 52 — cosmological constant via wave(zero-point) vs contact(gravitating); beat pairing.
The Lambda magnitude problem is a wave/contact confusion: the zero-point energy (wave, sum of 1/2 hbar w)
is ~cutoff^4 (huge); what GRAVITATES (contact) is what survives after the beat pairs boson (+) and fermion
(-) zero-point energies -- the substrate now HAS both (S49/S51). rho = 1/2 integral[omega_b - omega_f].
RESULT: exact pairing (m_b=m_f) -> gravitating vacuum = 0 EXACTLY (the huge wave zero-point does NOT
gravitate). Broken pairing (detuning Delta=m_f^2-m_b^2 > 0) -> the leading cutoff^4 CANCELS, but a softer
residue ~ Delta*cutoff^2 REMAINS (verified: rho_paired ~ Lc^2 at fixed Delta) -- the pairing softens
quartic->quadratic, set by the breaking scale.
HONEST RESERVE: this is the standard SUSY/pairing cancellation -- NOT novel, and NOT a solution. It reduces
cutoff^4 to the breaking scale but does NOT reach the observed tiny Lambda (~1e-122); the residual
hierarchy (breaking scale -> observed Lambda) is the unsolved magnitude problem, unsolved by everyone.
Content here: the wave/contact translation correctly shows the bulk zero-point need not gravitate; the
beat supplies the pairing. Suggestive, conceptual -- not a closed result.
