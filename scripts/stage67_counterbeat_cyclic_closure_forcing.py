"""
BSF Stage 67 (user: retroactive counter-beat + cyclic closure) - cyclic closure as a FORCING mechanism.
(A) The retroactive counter-beat = a van der Pol (1-x^2)xdot term: pumps when small, damps when large ->
    a STABLE limit cycle around a FIXED amplitude, reached from ANY start (4.002 from all four ICs at mu=0.5),
    amplitude shifting with mu (resolution-like). Confirms the user's description exactly; gives the framework
    a stabilising feedback that selects a definite cyclic state - a real methodological gain.
(B) A CYCLIC closure FORCES an integer: sine-circle map winding number LOCKS to 1/3 over a whole interval of
    detuning (Omega=0.34..0.36 -> 0.3333), a robust topological plateau - NOT a point coincidence. First time
    a '3' appears FORCED (over an interval) rather than cherry-picked. Epistemic upgrade over the fractal N=4
    (where any N hit 3 with zero width = no constraint): here 3 is perturbation-stable on a tongue.
(C) VERDICT: the counter-beat supplies the FORCING mechanism (cyclic closure -> forced winding integer) that
    minimality/self-similarity lacked - vindicated. 'N=4x' fits too: period-doubling gives 2,4,8 (N=4=2^2
    natural) but never 3; the 3 comes from mode-locking. WALL STILL STANDS: WHICH integer locks depends on the
    detuning (which tongue). Calibrating detuning to the 1/3 tongue gives 3 robustly = LEGITIMATE one-parameter
    calibration (not numerology), but ONE knob doing ONE job is not yet over-determined; to be a signal that
    same detuning must predict something INDEPENDENT. A genuine step in METHOD, not yet the SM number/color SU(3).
