"""
BSF Stage 77 (user: can one scale-fixing axiom set masses, G and Lambda?) - NO; the obstruction is the
hierarchy + cosmological-constant problems (the two great unsolved gaps of all physics).
[1] The three live at hierarchically-separated scales: M_Planck/m_proton ~ 1.3e19 (hierarchy problem),
    Lambda^(1/4)/M_Planck ~ 1.9e-31 (cosmological-constant problem). A single kink value fixes ONE unit; it
    cannot produce ratios of 1e19 and 1e-31 without putting them in by hand.
[2] Kink TOPOLOGY gives integer/simple mass ratios, but observed ratios are messy (m_mu/m_e=206.85,
    m_tau/m_e=3477.5) - so the kink picture quantises mass but does NOT give the observed spectrum; the
    spectrum needs many free (Yukawa-like) parameters.
[3] In the framework the three depend on DIFFERENT parameters at DIFFERENT scales: mass <- kink/soliton
    energy (S36); G_eff <- coupling lambda (S41); Lambda <- IR scale L (S64, catastrophe already removed).
VERDICT: one scale-fixing axiom = a legitimate CALIBRATION (one unit), doing ONE job; it does not cascade to
G or Lambda (different scales) nor fix the mass ratios. Masses/G/Lambda cannot be improved beyond calibration
here - their magnitudes/ratios are exactly where ALL of physics is stuck (hierarchy + CC problems). Honest floor.
