BSF Stage 70 (user: threshold + scale progression) - does growing resistance settle the 3?
The counter-beat coupling K grows with cluster size; the locking threshold is K=1 = the CRITICAL point where
the substrate sits (S31/S55). RESULT: (1) the 1/3 lock is fragile below threshold (width 0.006 at K=0.5) and
ROBUST at K=1 (0.031) - so criticality is exactly the threshold; primordial(quasiperiodic)->locked(structured)
transition is physically coherent (raccords to cluster saturation). (2) tongue widths at K=1: 1/2 (0.073) >
1/3 = 2/3 (0.031) > 1/4 (0.014) > 1/5 (sub-scan-resolution, NOT a real cutoff) - a continuous Farey hierarchy.
The threshold makes the three lowest locks (1/1,1/2,1/3) all robust/physical (suggestive of three stable
generations) but does NOT force exactly three (widths continue past three). (3) resistance growing with size,
saturating at K=1, gives the primordial->locked transition. VERDICT: threshold REAL (=criticality), 1/3
ENABLED and made natural; 'exactly three' needs a SATURATION/cutoff truncating the hierarchy at the third
rung, which is POSITED not derived. AXIOM-CANDIDATE (qualitative): the substrate's restoring resistance grows
with structure size and saturates; with criticality it makes 1/1,1/2,1/3 stable cyclic states and truncates
at three. Derived part: threshold=criticality, 1/3 robust, Farey order. Posited part (narrow, qualitative):
truncation at three. Posable honestly (like Z3), naming the posited piece.
