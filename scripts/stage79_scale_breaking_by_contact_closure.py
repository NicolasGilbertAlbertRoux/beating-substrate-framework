"""
BSF Stage 79 (user: S78 closed too fast - does the model break scale-invariance INTERNALLY?). The user is
right: S78 only rules out the EXACTLY scale-free case. The model has scale-breaking ingredients (dissipation,
lockings, contact closures) that can SELECT a scale - and dimensional transmutation can generate hierarchies.
[A] A feedback/closure DOES select a definite scale (van der Pol limit-cycle attractor: amplitude 2/sqrt(beta),
    start-independent). But it tracks the closure coefficient beta -> for the ABSOLUTE scale the freedom
    relocates to that coefficient (not absolute-from-nothing).
[B] DIMENSIONAL TRANSMUTATION (the real lead): a dimensionless coupling g0 that runs generates an exponential
    scale RATIO Lambda/mu0 = exp(-1/(2 b g0^2)) (g0=0.25 -> ~35 orders). This is how QCD makes Lambda_QCD and
    how hierarchies are NATURAL. The model's closures could transmute into the mass/Planck ratio.
[C] IRONCLAD CEILING (dimensional analysis): a dimensionful number needs ONE reference scale - so ONE anchor
    (a unit = the posited kink value, a legitimate calibration) is unavoidable. But RATIOS can emerge on top.
    S78 conflated 'absolute scale' (needs 1 unit) with 'ratios' (can emerge) - that was the over-reach.
[D] G ~ (induced curvature)/(kink energy) can share the UV/kink/closure lock; Lambda ~ 1/L_IR^2 (horizon) is a
    SEPARATE IR scale -> plausibly a SECOND lock. The user's anticipation is correct.
VERDICT: the door is RE-OPENED. Honest live program: (1) posit ONE kink/closure unit (unavoidable anchor);
(2) seek the dimensionless closure that transmutes into the mass/G hierarchy; (3) test whether Lambda follows
the same lock or a second IR/horizon lock. RESERVE: transmutation is the right TYPE of mechanism and a genuine
avenue, but it is NOT yet shown that the model's specific closures produce the OBSERVED hierarchy or the messy
mass spectrum - that remains to be done. Corrects S78's over-reach; magnitudes are a live avenue, not a closed door.
