BSF Stage 20 — conservative RATCHET: does an asymmetric SURFACE + a regular BEAT rectify a
directed flux? (author's design: asymmetry in the surface; the beat stays regular for coherence.)
N particles on a ring in an asymmetric periodic surface V(theta), AC-forced by a regular beat
that is a DYNAMICAL DOF per particle (energy-conserving; NO dissipation, NO external clock).

  H = sum_i[ p_i^2/2 + V(theta_i) + pi_i^2/2 + (Om^2/2) b_i^2 + lam*b_i*cos(theta_i) ]
  V(theta) = -V0[ sin(theta) + (r/2) sin(2 theta) ]   (r != 0 breaks spatial symmetry = ratchet)
A PER-PARTICLE beat (O(1) coupling) is essential: a single global beat coupled to a sum over N
particles scales as N, stiffens the dynamics and WRECKS energy conservation (my first attempts:
E drift 1-8%, controls non-zero, results jumped between runs -- all artifact). Per-particle beat
gives E drift ~1e-5 and clean controls.

RESULT (validated: E drift ~1e-5, controls ~0): NO directed current. TEST = -1.0e-3 +- 4.2e-3,
symmetric-control = -7e-4, no-beat-control = -6e-4 -- all SMALLER than their seed scatter, i.e.
all consistent with ZERO. The asymmetric-surface + regular-beat conservative ratchet does NOT
rectify a net current. This confirms the pre-registered HAMILTONIAN SUM RULE: in a dissipationless
system the net current over a symmetric ensemble cancels; directed transport needs DISSIPATION or
a prepared broken-symmetry state. CONSTRAINT for the author's "polarized flux paths -> magnetism":
directed flux cannot arise from a purely conservative substrate -- it requires the (later-emerging)
dissipation or symmetry breaking. The emergence of dissipation thus becomes the linchpin of the
flux/magnetism program. Honest: 1D conservative toy, functional, not nature.
