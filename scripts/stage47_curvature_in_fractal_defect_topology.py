"""
BSF Stage 47 — the curvature/spin lives in the (fractal) defect topology, not added to the substrate.
Exploring the user's two ideas for where a spin-2 / curvature comes from: (idea 2) it lives in the
TOPOLOGY of the flux skeletons (the vortex/defect network), and (idea 1) it can traverse the resolutions
along a FRACTAL path. Both are correct and concrete here.

IDEA 2 (exact geometry): a disclination IS a point of Gaussian curvature (S45, the cone). By Gauss-Bonnet
the integral of K over a region = the enclosed sum of deficits, so K = coarse-grained DISCLINATION DENSITY
(Kleinert). Curvature is carried by the defect/flux-skeleton topology, not by the smooth substrate.
IDEA 1 (measured): if the defects are distributed on a FRACTAL (critical, S31) set, the curvature field
is SCALE-INVARIANT -- same structure at every resolution. Curvature power-spectrum slope: FRACTAL (2D
Cantor dust, dim 1.262) = -2.21 (power law, scale-invariant -> traverses resolutions); UNIFORM (Poisson)
= -0.31 (flat/white -> no scale traversal).

HONEST: this is the SOURCE geometry -- WHERE the curvature/spin lives (the fractal flux topology) -- which
the user located correctly, complementing S45 (one defect = exact curvature) and S31 (criticality=fractal).
It is NOT the propagating spin-2 graviton DYNAMICS (S46 boundary stands): the user's idea resolves the
'where', not yet the 'how it propagates'. Slopes are illustrative (depend on smearing/fractal details);
the robust result is the qualitative contrast fractal(power-law) vs uniform(white).
