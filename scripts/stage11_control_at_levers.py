"""
BSF Stage 11 — refined claim: the FAST controls the SLOW where the LEVERS (attractors)
are accessible, and SPEED lets it catch the fleeting lever. (author's sharpened ontology.)

Slow bistable plant: dx = a(x - x^3) dt + noise dW + u dt. Wells at +/-1, barrier at 0.
Start in the + well; goal: flip to the - well. Control input u is SMALL (below the
deterministic barrier force) and is applied ONLY when |x| is near the barrier (= lever
accessible). A FAST controller samples every step (catches noise excursions to the lever);
a SLOW controller samples rarely (misses them).

PRE-REGISTERED (can fail): FAST+noise flips often; SLOW+noise rarely (misses levers);
FAST+NO-noise ~never (no lever appears -> small input can't climb the barrier). This would
confirm BOTH: control needs accessible levers AND speed to catch them. Honest: model result.

# --- FOLLOW-UP (honest record): does controller SPEED / bandwidth matter? ---
# Tested 3 ways (long horizon; time pressure; bandwidth scan with controller period
# from 1 to 800 steps, i.e. up to ~12x SLOWER than the plant's ~50-67 step timescale).
# RESULT: flip rate stayed 1.00 at EVERY controller period. Controller speed does NOT
# matter for this attractor-SWITCHING task: one well-placed push at a lever suffices and
# time provides enough chances. The "faster-than-plant" principle applies to CONTINUOUS
# TRACKING/STABILIZATION (reacting to fast disturbances), NOT to occasional switching.
# CONCLUSION: LEVER access = CONFIRMED necessary; controller SPEED = REFUTED for switching.
