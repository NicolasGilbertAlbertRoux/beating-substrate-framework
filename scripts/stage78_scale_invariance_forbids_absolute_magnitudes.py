BSF Stage 78 (user: add wave/contact translation + action-reaction, scan for an axiomatic value; close with
G ~ induced-curvature / kink-energy). Result: the magnitudes are FORBIDDEN AS ABSOLUTES by the framework's
own scale-invariance - not a missing axiom.
[1] G as a coefficient is CORRECT (Sakharov / S41: G_eff=lambda^2/4pi). But lambda is itself free; fixing the
    kink energy relates G to (kink energy)x(coefficient) where the coefficient is the new free thing - freedom
    relocated, not removed; 'why lambda is tiny' = the hierarchy problem.
[2] The wave/contact translation and the beat give FORCED DIMENSIONLESS relations (v_ph*v_gr=c^2 exact,
    omega^2=c^2k^2+m^2) - ratios, carrying NO absolute unit.
[3] A scale-invariant substrate has NO preferred absolute scale: under x->a x, t->a t (k->k/a), the dispersion
    is preserved iff m->m/a, so only the dimensionless m*L is meaningful (invariant for a=1,10,1000). Every
    scale is physically equivalent -> no scan can pick out an absolute kink mass.
[4] DEEP TENSION: the SAME scale-invariance that removed the Lambda catastrophe (S64: no UV scale -> no
    Lambda^4) is EXACTLY what forbids deriving an absolute mass/G scale. A preferred scale would fix masses but
    revive the Lambda^4 catastrophe; scale-freedom kills the catastrophe but forbids absolute magnitudes. The
    virtue for Lambda is the obstruction for masses/G.
VERDICT: masses, G, Lambda magnitudes are not a missing axiom - they are forbidden-as-absolutes by scale-
invariance. Positing the kink value fixes a UNIT (calibration); ratios follow; absolute magnitudes cannot be
scanned out of a scale-free substrate. Honest floor, now with its reason.
