"""
BSF Stage 14b — two-wave bound state with the AUTHOR'S contact law (his specs):
 - ATTRACTION continuous, gravity/curvature-like: F_att = -G/d^2 (->0 at inf, ->large at 0).
 - REPULSION soft & diffuse (tennis-ball-like) when beating mantles overlap:
   F_rep = k*max(0, R1(t)+R2(t) - d),  R_i(t)=R0(1+A sin(omega t + phase_i)).  Continuous gate.
 - energy sustained by the beating. Separation d obeys m d'' = F_att + F_rep.

Exploratory scan (legitimate) WITH controls. Tests the author's two claims falsifiably:
 (1) is the BEATING necessary to bind? -> compare A>0 vs A=0 (static) at the same attraction.
 (2) is SYNCHRONIZATION necessary? -> compare in-phase vs anti-phase.
Outcomes: BOUND (d bounded), COLLAPSE (d->0), ESCAPE (d->inf).
PRE-REGISTERED targets to look for: a regime where STATIC collapses but BEATING binds
(=> beating necessary, author validated); and whether sync vs anti differ.
Honest: 1D toy of a 3D picture; this maps behavior, it is not a measurement of nature.
