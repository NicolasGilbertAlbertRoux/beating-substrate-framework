"""
BSF Stage 57 — can the spin-2 shear mode BE the graviton? A stability theorem (frontal attack on the wall).
By Weinberg-Deser, a massless Lorentz-invariant spin-2 field is FORCED to couple universally (equivalence
principle, gamma=1) -- a true graviton. We have the spin-2 carrier (S54), gapless (S43). The ONLY missing
condition is that it propagate at the LIGHT speed: c_T = c_L (Lorentz invariance at the light cone).
Isotropic elasticity: c_L^2=(lambda+2mu)/rho, c_T^2=mu/rho; stability needs bulk modulus K=lambda+2mu/3>0.
RESULT: c_T=c_L requires lambda=-mu => K=-mu/3 < 0 => mechanically UNSTABLE. In ANY stable substrate (K>0)
c_T < c_L STRICTLY (e.g. 0.87 at marginal stability, 0.71 at lambda=0). So the spin-2 shear mode is
necessarily SUB-LUMINAL -> not a Lorentz-invariant light-speed spin-2 -> Weinberg-Deser does not apply ->
it cannot be forced into a universal-coupling graviton.
INTERPRETATION: the wall holds for a precise SCIENTIFIC reason (a mechanical-stability bound), not a posit
of timidity. It converts "the 3+1 graviton is open" into the sharp statement "a stable elastic substrate
cannot make its spin-2 mode travel at c." The passage that works is exactly Kleinert's: a curvature/defect
field DECOUPLED from the elastic c_T, free to be light-speed -- posited at S46/S47, and now we know WHY it
must be posited (the elastic identification is obstructed by stability).
