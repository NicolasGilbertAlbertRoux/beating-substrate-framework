"""
BSF Stage 74 (user post-reading ontological feedback on the two SM inputs).
[A] PROPOSAL 1 - is colour Z3 the three phases of the beat (contraction/dilatation/in-between)? REFUTED as a
    derivation: a single beat has Z2 symmetry (cos(t+pi)=-cos(t), order 2), with TWO turning points, not a
    third equal state; a genuine Z3 needs three phases at 120deg (sum=0) = positing Z3 in another form; and
    colour is INTERNAL while beat phases are TEMPORAL (orthogonal, S69), so identifying them crosses that
    orthogonality. Appealing but relocates/conflates - does NOT derive Z3. P1 stays posited.
[B] PROPOSAL 2 - do extra generations fall below the resolution threshold? AFFIRMED - a real improvement.
    Tongue widths decrease (1/2=0.074>1/3=0.031>1/4=0.016>1/5=0.008>1/6~0); with the resolution threshold
    (the crenelage = socle II) cutting between the 3rd and 4th lock (theta~0.012), exactly THREE locks are
    detectable, the rest fall into the latent (undetectable). This UPGRADES P2: from 'hierarchy truncates at
    three' (ad hoc) to 'the hierarchy is infinite but only locks wider than the resolution are observable' -
    tied to the framework's CORE concept (resolution), and PREDICTS extra sub-threshold generations
    (heavier/undetectable), consistent with no observed light 4th generation. Residual posit shrinks to 'the
    resolution threshold sits between the 3rd and 4th lock' (a physical calibration, not an arbitrary number).
    Count three still threshold-dependent (not uniquely forced) but P2 is now natural, unified, content-ful.
