"""
BSF Stage 82 (user: recursive 'is-it-really-free?' protocol - do not accept 'gamma is free' from imported
critical-physics intuition; test it within the framework, recurse to a forced invariant or a demonstrated
boundary). CONCESSION: the prior 'gamma is non-universal because amplitudes are non-universal' was IMPORTED
standard intuition, not a within-BST demonstration - withdrawn.
Running the protocol:
[1] t is dynamically selected (S81). 
[2] A FULLY-FORCED nested tower t*=sqrt(y/sqrt(y/sqrt(y/...))) converges to y^(1/3) ~ O(1) (eta=1/4 -> 0.630,
    2/pi -> 0.860, 1 -> 1.0). An O(1) distance-to-criticality gives NO hierarchy.
[3] STRUCTURAL RESULT (not imported): the observed 10^19/10^-31 hierarchy CANNOT come from forced O(1)
    invariants alone - it requires somewhere either a genuinely free/small datum OR a transmutation step
    (S79: exp(-1/g^2)).
[4] To decide, WITHIN BST, whether that step is forced or free needs BST's ACTUAL feedback/closure flow (the
    origin of the contre-battement strength). We have only PHENOMENOLOGICAL models (van der Pol mu, S21
    Caldeira-Leggett) - the feedback dynamics has NEVER been derived from the substrate's first principles.
TERMINUS (honest): NOT 'gamma free' (imported - withdrawn), NOT 'gamma forced' (no derivation). A DEMONSTRATED
BOUNDARY of the model (protocol stop-condition #4b): the framework as developed lacks a first-principles
derivation of the feedback flow, so it cannot determine whether the recursion bottoms out at a forced invariant.
The genuine deep target is the FORCED COEFFICIENT of the substrate's feedback flow, IF it exists - found only
by DERIVING the contre-battement dynamics from first principles, not by asserting its status. That derivation
is the real open research step; we honestly do not have it. (Methodological note: the recursive 'is-it-really-
free?' protocol corrected premature closure three times this session - S78 too strong, S80 incomplete, the
gamma=free claim imported. It is recorded as the framework's method for the magnitude question.)
