"""
BSF Stage 64 (user point 1) — the cutoff is the problem: scale-invariance sets Lambda by the IR, not UV.
The Lambda ~ Planck^4 catastrophe comes ENTIRELY from imposing a UV cutoff. But the substrate is critical =
scale-invariant (S31/S55): no preferred UV scale. In a scale-free vacuum the energy density cannot depend on
a cutoff (there is none); by dimensional analysis it depends only on the IR scale L.
RESULT: (a) with cutoff Lc, rho ~ Lc^4 explodes (2.5e3 -> 2.5e15). (b) scale-invariant: rho ~ 1/L^2,
cutoff-INDEPENDENT (rho*L^2 = 0.1309 const). The Lc^4 disaster is an artifact of imposing a cutoff on a
scale-free theory. With L = horizon, rho_Lambda ~ 1/L_horizon^2 = the observed ORDER (holographic value).
HONEST RESERVE: scale-invariant / holographic dark-energy resolution (established proposals). What the
substrate's criticality (S31/S55) adds: scale-invariance is its own fixed point, not ad hoc. REMAINING
assumptions: exact scale-invariance (no anomaly) and L = horizon. The Lc^4 catastrophe is REMOVED and the
magnitude reframed to ~1/L^2; the residual 'why L = horizon' is milder, not fully closed. A real reframing,
not a from-nothing derivation. The user's intuition (the cutoff is the problem) holds.
