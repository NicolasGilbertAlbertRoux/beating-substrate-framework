"""
BSF Stage 14c — FAITHFUL to the author's spec: the beat is a CONSERVATIVE INTERNAL MODE
(energy conserved), not an external drive. Hamiltonian:
  H = p_d^2/2m + p_b^2/2mu - G/d + 1/2 kappa b^2 + 1/2 k*O^2,  O=max(0, 2(R0+b)-d)
  (gravity/curvature-like attraction; mantle-breathing beat oscillator; soft diffuse contact)
Symplectic leapfrog -> total energy conserved (|E drift| ~ 1e-4).

RESULT (robust, content-bearing): WITHOUT the beat (beat_E=0) the pair ALWAYS collapses
(attraction wins) at every G tested. WITH a matched internal beat it BINDS over a real
REGION of (G, beat energy) -- a 'Goldilocks' diagonal band: stronger attraction needs more
beat energy; too little -> collapse, too much -> escape. So the energy-conserving beat is
NECESSARY to prevent collapse and stabilize the pair -- supporting the author's claim that
beating is necessary for stabilization / to counter chaos. (Earlier Stage 14b found the
beat 'destabilizing' -- that was an artifact of a NON-conservative external-drive model;
honoring the author's energy-conservation spec reversed it.) Honest: 1D toy, functional
result, not a measurement of nature -- but the static control could have bound and never did.
Requires numpy.
