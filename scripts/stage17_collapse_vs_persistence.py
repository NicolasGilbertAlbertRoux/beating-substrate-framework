BSF Stage 17 — does the BEAT prevent COLLAPSE? (revisits S16's too-quick "generic" verdict)
The static contact potential U = -G/d + (k/2)max(0,2R0-d)^2 has a finite soft repulsion but a
-G/d attraction that diverges at d->0: its GLOBAL minimum is COLLAPSE to a point. A static
extended cluster is only METASTABLE. Claim (author's "movement vs death"): the BEAT robustly
stabilizes extended structure where the static collapses under perturbation.

Take an octahedron (N=6) at the equilibrium spacing; evolve with small dissipation + noise
(perturbations probing metastability); track the MINIMUM pairwise distance over time.
PRE-REGISTERED: static cluster COLLAPSES under noise (some pair distance -> ~0) while the
BEATING cluster stays EXTENDED (min distance stays near equilibrium). Control that could fail:
the beating might also collapse, or the static might NOT (deep enough metastable well).
Honest: 3D toy, functional, not nature.

RESULT: hypothesis NOT supported. At moderate noise (0.05) NEITHER collapses (0/5 both); at
strong noise (0.12) BOTH disperse to a gas (not collapse). The octahedron's geometric rigidity
holds the static cluster -- each pair is kept apart by the others, so the isolated-pair collapse
(S14c) does NOT extend to the cluster. Only a faint directional hint (static creeps inward,
beating drifts outward). VERDICT: the beat is NOT shown to prevent collapse at the cluster level;
claim withdrawn. (The PAIR-level S14c result stands; the cluster adds rigidity the pair lacks.)
NOTE on S16: the framing was the real flaw -- the beat is independently motivated (Axiom III,
kinetics for action/retroaction), so static is the DEGENERATE case, not the bar to beat. "Beat
provides needed kinetics + does not break structure + anneals order from random" is a fair
POSITIVE reading; the invented "beat static at geometry" bar was not the relevant one.
