BSF Stage 15 — what ARCHITECTURES self-organize? (no polyhedra assumed; observe + detect.)
N beating spheres in 3D with the validated contact law (attraction -G/d^2 + soft repulsion
when mantles overlap). Relax from RANDOM initial positions; characterize what emerges, and
compare to a random-point NULL to see if regularity is SELECTED or generic.

Detectors (standard cluster-physics tools): nearest-neighbour distance regularity (CV =
std/mean; low = regular), mean coordination number, and the geometry vs known small clusters.
Run multiple seeds: do the SAME architectures recur (robust) or is it seed-dependent?

PRE-REGISTERED: relaxed clusters far MORE regular than the random null (CV much lower),
recurring across seeds => the dynamics SELECTS architecture. HONEST DISCRIMINATOR: these are
likely the GENERIC attraction+core (Lennard-Jones-like) geometries -- regular structure here
is EXPECTED and NOT distinctive to beating; distinctiveness would need beating-specific
geometry differing from a static soft-core control. 1D->3D, functional, not nature.

RESULT: small N (4,6) form PERFECT regular polyhedra (tetrahedron, octahedron), robust
across seeds, CV=0 vs null CV~0.35-0.52 -> dynamics SELECTS architecture. Large N (>=8):
UNRESOLVED -- damped relaxation got trapped in disorder; a simulated-annealing attempt
DISPERSED the cluster (mean coordination <2 = fragmented). Finding mid-N global minima is a
known-hard optimization problem (needs basin hopping / careful schedules); quick scripts are
inadequate, so large-N architecture is NOT determined here. CAVEAT: even the small-N polyhedra
are GENERIC (any attraction+core gives them) -- NOT distinctive to beating. Real content
question (untested): does the BEATING produce geometry differing from a STATIC soft-core?
