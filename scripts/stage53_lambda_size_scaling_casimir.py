"""
BSF Stage 53 — does Lambda vary with the bounded size L? (the substrate's restoring tension; user lead 6a).
The substrate's restoring tension (axiom III, return-to-equilibrium) confined to a region of size L = the
finite-size (Casimir) part of the zero-point energy. Modes omega_n = n*pi/L; subtract the extensive bulk
(~L/eps^2, the cutoff vacuum); the L-dependent CASIMIR residue is the gravitating (contact) tension.
RESULT: E_Casimir * L = -pi/24 = -0.1309 constant across L=1..16 -> E_Casimir ~ 1/L, energy DENSITY ~ 1/L^2.
So Lambda decreases as 1/L^2: negligible toward large L, formidable toward small L = exactly the user's
intuition (a scale-dependent feedback tension).
HONEST RESERVE: this is Casimir / holographic dark energy (established idea, Lambda ~ 1/L^2). With L = the
horizon it gives the right ORDER of magnitude (the Lambda ~ H0^2 coincidence), but L=horizon is an INPUT,
not derived -> the magnitude is matched, not solved. The SCALING (1/L^2) is the genuine result and it
vindicates the lead; the absolute magnitude stays open.
