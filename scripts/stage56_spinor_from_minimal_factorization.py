BSF Stage 56 — spin-1/2 FORCED by the shortest (minimal first-order) factorization (spinor half of the wall).
Demand the minimal first-order square root of the substrate's own wave operator (omega^2 - k^2 - m^2, from
S34/S36/S51). This single demand forces, with nothing posited by hand:
(0) scalars CANNOT do it ({g^0,g^1}=0 with g^0^2=1,g^1^2=-1 has no scalar solution) -> a 1-component
    (scalar) substrate is impossible; a multi-component spinor is required.
(1) the Clifford algebra {g^mu,g^nu}=2 eta^mu nu (exact, dev 0).
(2) the square-root property (g.k)^2=(k0^2-|k|^2) I (exact, 1.7e-16) -> squares back to the wave operator.
(3) rotation generator S12=(i/4)[g1,g2] with eigenvalues +/-1/2 (SPIN-1/2) and the 4pi DOUBLE COVER
    (U(2pi)=-I, U(4pi)=+I).
So spin-1/2 is the forced cost of minimality ("nature takes the shortest path", user's key). The SAME
minimality principle singles out the graviton: GR is the unique consistent self-coupling of a massless
spin-2 (Weinberg-Deser), and the spin-2 carrier already exists in the shear sector (S54). BOTH halves of
the 3D-rotation wall yield to one principle.
HONEST RESERVE: this is Dirac's 1928 derivation (established), not novel. The substrate adds: the wave
operator is its own, and minimality (first-order = causal + positive-definite density) is the selection
principle (well-motivated, adopted). What is FORCED is the representation content (spinor/Clifford/spin-1/2/
double cover). What is NOT built: the full 3+1 Dirac field as an explicit emergent lattice dynamics (S51 was
1+1D), and the graviton's universal coupling MAGNITUDE (S46). The 'why these reps' wall closes; the
constructive 'build it with the right couplings' wall stays open.
