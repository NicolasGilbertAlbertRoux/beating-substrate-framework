BSF Stage 80 (user: are masses, G, Lambda three projections of one universal closure invariant?).
ANSWER, in two levels:
ONTOLOGICALLY - YES (the user is right): masses, G, Lambda ARE three faces/projections of the ONE substrate's
  closure-and-resolution structure; they are NOT independent fundamentals. A real ontological unification.
QUANTITATIVELY - NO, and the reason is now located sharply: the framework's UNIVERSAL forced closure
  invariants (eta=1/4, NK jump 2/pi, spin-1/2, helicity-2) are CRITICAL-point values - scale-invariant, so
  they carry NO scale and generate NO hierarchy. The separation between masses/G/Lambda (factors 10^19,
  10^-31) is OFF-critical content: free relevant couplings (hierarchy factor exp(-1/2bt^2), t free -> any
  hierarchy) plus an IR/horizon scale. masses & G can share ONE UV off-critical flow; Lambda ~ 1/L_IR^2 needs
  a separate IR/horizon lock -> at least TWO independent locks, not one universal invariant.
VERDICT (clean localisation): there is NO single universal closure invariant that FIXES masses, G and Lambda
  quantitatively. The last great quantitative lock is precisely the OFF-CRITICAL FLOW PATTERN (the hierarchy)
  + the IR scale - the non-universal data the substrate does not fix. Unified in ontology, free in magnitude;
  the universals live AT criticality, the hierarchy lives OFF it. The frontier is mapped, not slammed shut.
