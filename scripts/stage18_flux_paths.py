"""
BSF Stage 18 — does the BEAT open flux/wave PATHS that a COOLED STATIC medium excludes?
(the author's "chemins ondulatoires/flux" claim; the dynamical frame where content has lived.)
A dissipative 1D chain. Drive one end; measure the signal reaching the FAR end.
- STATIC (cooled, dead): fixed coupling + dissipation -> the wave damps and DIES before crossing.
- BEATING (coherent): coupling stiffness beats k(t)=k0(1+A sin omega t) (mantles beat) -> can
  PUMP the mode (parametric gain) and keep the channel OPEN against dissipation.
- RANDOM-PHASE control: each bond beats with a random phase -> incoherent, no coherent pumping.
PRE-REGISTERED: coherent BEATING delivers MORE signal to the far end than the dead static
(opens a flux path), while RANDOM-PHASE does NOT (so it's the COHERENT kinetics, not mere
modulation). If beating ~ static at all omega -> claim NOT supported. omega scan reported in
full (parametric effects are resonant; no cherry-picking). Honest: 1D toy, functional, not nature.

RESULT: INVALID as designed. Modelling the beat as an EXTERNAL stiffness modulation injects
unbounded energy -> parametric RESONANCE INSTABILITY (far-end "signal" 1e5..1e27 = the sim
diverging, NOT transmission). This repeats the S14b error (a non-energy-conserving beat).
So this does NOT support the flux-path claim. HONEST PHYSICS TENSION: keeping a flux channel
open against a dissipative ("cooled") static REQUIRES energy input; an energy-conserving
internal beat can feed transport only TRANSIENTLY from a finite reserve. A cooled static SOLID
still carries phonons (it does not "exclude" wave paths) -- it lets them DIE under dissipation.
The real, limited core: a beating substrate is never at rest so has PERSISTENT flux a quiescent
static lacks, but this draws on stored energy (not free/perpetual). NEXT: redesign with an
INTERNAL energy-conserving beat coupled to the transport mode; measure a directed PERSISTENT
current vs uniform/incoherent controls (a control that can fail), no energy injection.
