"""
BSF Stage 30 — does a calibration at ONE resolution reach DOWN the resolution chain? (the author's
question.) A hierarchy of resolutions z_0 (coarsest = observable) ... z_{L-1} (deepest latent),
coupled scale-to-scale by the substrate with strength c (each finer scale = c*g(coarser) +
independent fine detail). We calibrate/train a predictor using ONLY the observable z_0 and ask how
well it predicts each deeper latent scale, out-of-sample (R^2 vs depth).

PRE-REGISTERED: coupled (c>0) -> the observable predicts the near latent well, R^2 DECAYING with
depth (calibration reaches a finite depth set by c); decoupled (c=0) -> R^2~0 at every depth (a
calibrated observable says nothing about the latent). The decay tells us HOW FAR one resolution's
calibration propagates -- and whether the deep latent is forever beyond observable calibration
(consistent with S8 saturation / S13 "infinitely latent"). Honest: a generic cascade model; it
measures the STRUCTURE of cross-resolution calibration transfer, a real and answerable question,
not a derivation of physics.
