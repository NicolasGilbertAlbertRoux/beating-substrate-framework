BSF Stage 71 (user: attack the Dirac 3+1 build) - how far do substrate c-movers reach in 3+1?
Substrate ingredients: c-movers per spatial direction + contact-reversal (mass) = the Dirac operator
H = alpha.p + beta*m. S51 built this in 1+1 (Feynman checkerboard); here 3+1.
RESULT: the 3+1 Dirac OPERATOR is reconstructed exactly - H^2=(p^2+m^2)I to 2.9e-17, eigenvalues +-sqrt(p^2+m^2)
each doubled (4-spinor = 2 spin x 2 energy), all {alpha_i,alpha_j}=0 / {alpha_i,beta}=0 / beta^2=I exact,
chirality conserved at m=0 (mass mixes L<->R = the 1+1 zitterbewegung of S51 now in 3+1). Forced by the
Clifford reps of S56. THE CONSTRUCTIVE GAP located precisely and SHRUNK: the build requires the 3 spatial
movers to anticommute pairwise; in 1+1 there is no such condition (one space direction) so S51 closed; in 3+1
this pairwise anticommutation IS the GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA of 3D space (Pauli sigma_i with sigma_i sigma_j +
sigma_j sigma_i = 2 delta_ij = a rep of Cl(3,0)). So the missing ingredient is how DIRECTED quantities compose
in space - the geometric product - which the geometric substrate (grad-theta = geometry) naturally carries IF
movers compose via the geometric product. CONCLUSION: 3+1 Dirac CLOSES modulo one natural, on-theme
identification (movers compose via space's geometric product); the wall goes from a vague gap to a single
almost-free geometric ingredient. HONEST RESERVE: the geometric-product composition is an assumption (very
natural, tied to the grad-theta through-line, but an assumption, not a derivation).
