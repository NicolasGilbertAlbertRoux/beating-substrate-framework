"""
BSF Stage 75 (user: two new hypotheses for colour Z3).
[1] DIRECTIONAL DISPLACEMENT + back-reaction (user's main bet) - the STRONGEST colour lead so far. The 120deg
    rotation about (1,1,1) cyclically permutes the axes x->y->z->x (verified orthogonal, det+1, R^3=I) = Z3.
    The full permutation group of 3 directions is S3 = EXACTLY the Weyl group of SU(3); the cyclic Z3 = EXACTLY
    the centre of SU(3). So three directions carry the precise group skeleton of colour SU(3) (far stronger
    than the beat-phase Z2 idea). HONEST BIND: colour is INTERNAL (commutes with Lorentz; Coleman-Mandula).
    Large spatial dims -> colour spacetime-entangled, contradicts internal (S69). Internal/compact dims ->
    legitimately internal Z3/S3 but positing 3 internal directions = positing colour again. Right SHAPE
    (S3/Z3 = SU(3) skeleton), realisation still relocates the posit; not yet a derivation. Upgrades colour
    from 'fully posited' to 'right group skeleton identified, blocked by the internal-vs-spacetime bind'.
[2] ROTATION (+ counter-rotation) - rotation in a plane is SO(2)/U(1) (continuous, no natural 3); and a
    rotating wave = intrinsic angular momentum = SPIN, already carried by root R1 (grade-2 bivectors ->
    spin-1/2, spin-2). So hypothesis 2 reproduces the SPIN sector, not a new colour Z3; counter-rotation just
    stabilises a limit cycle in the angle. User's instinct to bet less on it is correct.
VERDICT: #1 is the stronger bet and gives the first exact SU(3) group-skeleton echo from a substrate feature,
blocked only by the internal-vs-spacetime bind; #2 lands on spin (R1), not colour.
