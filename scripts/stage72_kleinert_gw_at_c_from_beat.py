"""
BSF Stage 72 (Kleinert / GW-at-c) - where does the speed c of the spin-2 field come from?
A transverse-traceless spin-2 field has helicity 2 at ANY speed (rotates e^{2i phi}, verified ratio 2.0000).
Its speed = sqrt(stiffness/inertia). Two substrate origins: elastic shear mu -> v=0.444<c (S57 problem) OR the
conservative BEAT -> v=1=c (S34 light cone). RESULT: GW-at-c is REACHABLE conditional on ONE named
identification - the spin-2 CURVATURE (disclination) field takes its kinetic/restoring term from the
conservative beat (S34, already derived at c), not the elastic shear. Then omega=c*k for a helicity-2 mode =
gravitational waves at c; with the trace-reversed source (S58) -> full Einstein bending (gamma=1). THE POSIT,
precisely: 'the curvature field couples to the beat, not the shear' - exactly where the user's action/feedback
= beat/counter-beat belongs (the curvature field's kinetic term). Natural (beat = fundamental conservative
mode, axiom III; curvature = fundamental geometry) but a POSIT, not a derivation. Wall reduced from 'needs a
posited light-speed spin-2 field' to 'curvature kinetic term = the beat' - a single named on-theme identification.
