"""
BSF Stage 12 — INVISIBLE LATENT CONTROL (author's reframed claim). Speed's role is not
control-bandwidth (refuted in S11) but INVISIBILITY: a latent oscillating faster than the
observable's sampling/resolution is ALIASED -> invisible to the observable's crenelage; yet
it can still CONTROL the slow plant via levers (S11). The observable sees only the EFFECT
(its slow state), not the CAUSE (the fast latent).

Part A — invisibility by temporal aliasing: a fast latent (freq f_L) sampled by a SLOW
observable yields a WRONG (aliased) recovered frequency; a FAST observer recovers f_L.
Part B — control: the SAME fast latent flips the slow bistable plant (lever-gated push).

PRE-REGISTERED (can fail): slow observer recovers freq != f_L (invisible); fast observer
recovers ~f_L (it's really there); and the fast latent flips the plant (controls it).
Honest: a model demonstration uniting aliasing (resolution channel) + lever control (S11).

# --- ESSENTIAL CONTROL (honest record): does the latent CONTROL, or does noise flip? ---
# Compared latent-ON vs no-latent (baseline) across noise levels 0.10..0.45. Control gain
# (ON - baseline) was <=0.04 everywhere: the latent push does NOT beat noise-driven escape.
# => Part B (invisible latent CONTROL) FAILS: the latent is invisible (Part A, solid) but
# does NOT demonstrably control the plant; noise does the flipping. This ALSO retroactively
# corrects Stage 11: that 'lever control confirmed' lacked a no-push baseline; with it, the
# push adds ~nothing, so S11's control claim was likely a noise artifact too.
# WHAT HOLDS: invisibility via aliasing (resolution channel). WHAT FAILS: latent control.
