"""
BSF Stage 14 — the ATOMIC brick of the author's wave-contact ontology: do two beating
spheres form a STABLE bound oscillation, and does it require SYNCHRONIZATION?
(funnel: cheapest fail-fast test before any big topology scan.)

Model (author's mechanism, my explicit choices -- to be corrected):
 - each sphere has a beating radius R_i(t) = R0(1 + A sin(omega t + phase_i)).
 - REPULSION when mantles overlap (expansion-driven collision): F_rep = k_r*max(0, R1+R2 - d).
 - SUCTION/void during contraction (each wave falls back): F_suc = -k_s*max(0, -sin(omega t)).
 - separation d obeys m d'' = F_rep + F_suc.
Outcome classified as: BOUND (d stays in a bounded oscillating range), FLY-APART (d->inf),
or COLLAPSE (d->0).

PRE-REGISTERED (each can fail):
 - k_s=0 (no suction): FLY-APART (repulsion alone can't bind) -> suction is necessary.
 - some k_s window: BOUND (the cycle the author describes).
 - desynchronized (phase offset pi): binding DEGRADES/lost -> tests the synchronicity claim.
RESULT (honest, INCONCLUSIVE): with MY crude force choices, no synchronized bound state
forms (collapse or fly-apart); only ANTI-phase binds (opposite to the synchronicity claim).
BUT this is dominated by an arbitrary modeling choice -- the 'suction' was a constant,
DISTANCE-INDEPENDENT, phase-gated pull, which is unphysical for a void/suction. So this does
NOT refute the author's picture; it reveals that the picture's behavior hinges entirely on
the precise CONTACT FORCE LAW (suction/repulsion as a function of separation AND phase),
which is unspecified. NEXT (funnel): the author specifies the contact mechanics precisely
(quantitative ontology) -> implement THAT faithfully -> the brick test becomes decisive ->
only then scan N-wave polyhedra, with an out-of-sample control (does the dynamics SELECT
regular polyhedra from random init vs a null, not just reproduce what was put in?).
Honest: a 1D toy of a 3D picture; the load-bearing unknown is the contact force law.
