"""
BSF Stage 76 (user: attempt to derive colour) - the obstruction is a THEOREM (Coleman-Mandula), not a gap.
Tested the user's refined hypothesis: a directional triplet true at ALL scales (latent & observable). DECISIVE
test: colour must COMMUTE with Lorentz (a red and a green quark have identical spin/mass/kinematics; a rotation
does not change a quark's colour). A directional triplet transforms under rotations (the three axes mix:
x->y, y->-x under a 90deg rotation about z), and being scale-invariant does NOT change this. So a spatial/
geometric triplet CANNOT be the internal colour - Coleman-Mandula (internal symmetry must be a direct product
with Poincare, i.e. commute). The S3/Z3 directional echo (S75) is real but lives in the SPATIAL/SPIN sector
(root R1, which transforms under Lorentz), NOT internal colour. Loopholes: SUSY (adds unobserved superpartners)
or Kaluza-Klein (gauge symmetry from extra COMPACT dimensions separate from the 4 large ones, hence internal) -
the latent can host such compact internal directions but does NOT force them; positing them IS positing colour.
VERDICT: colour cannot be derived from the large spatial directions (a theorem forbids it); it is necessarily
a POSITED internal sector, naturally homed in the latent. We tried and found the obstruction is a theorem, not
a missing step. Honest end of the colour question - stop without regret.
