BSF Stage 65 (user point 2 + prognosis) - fractal latent tower, WITH and WITHOUT LIM (Latent Information
Mechanics, the 3rd rung of the OMM->SBT->LIM->BST ladder). The substrate is critical = scale-invariant
(S31/S55), so its latent layers form a SELF-SIMILAR tower: decimating the finest latent layer maps to a
rescaled copy. Layer map = exact 1D Ising decimation.
RESULTS: (A) self-similarity FORCES a discrete geometric tower (xi halves each layer, ratio 0.5 exact) - the
fractal 'form of the latent', REAL. (B) internal structure = number of RELEVANT directions at the fixed point
(codimension of the critical surface = a FORCED integer): WITHOUT LIM (bare geometry) = 1 (scale axis only);
WITH LIM (latent-information channel on) = 2 (scale + information). So LIM is what ADDS internal DOF on top of
bare geometry - the user's mechanism structurally vindicated. (C) HONEST WALL: 1 and 2 are NOT 3 generations,
NOT SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1). The universality class is an INPUT, so a self-similar tower alone does not single out
the SM numbers. 'Invoke Dirac': self-similarity gives rescaled COPIES (right shape for generations-as-copies)
but exactly THREE with the right mass ratios is not forced. Identifying 'relevant directions' with 'internal
sectors' is an interpretation, not established. Forced = the FORM; the SM-specific numbers = still the wall.
