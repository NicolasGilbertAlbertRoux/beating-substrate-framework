"""
BSF Stage 23 — the COMB / polarity signature: does "inverse comb" attract and "identical comb"
repel, from geometry ALONE? (the author's magnetism intuition.) Two surfaces with an asymmetric
tooth ("comb") profile face each other. ALL waves interact by the SAME isotropic pair law
(attraction + soft core) -- orientation-blind by construction. Only the GEOMETRY of meshing vs
clashing differs:
  - INVERSE  (offset = period/2): teeth of B slot into the gaps of A -> they can MESH/approach.
  - IDENTICAL(offset = 0):        peak meets peak -> teeth CLASH -> forced apart.
  - FLAT (amp=0): control -- no teeth, so orientation must NOT matter.
We scan the face-to-face gap and report the binding (min interaction energy) for each.

Pair potential V(r)=r^-12 - 2 r^-6 (clean minimum at r=1; stand-in for attraction+hard core, so
energy stays well-defined). PRE-REGISTERED: inverse binds DEEPER (more attraction) at a smaller
gap; identical is shallower/repulsive; flat shows NO orientation dependence. A control could fail
(both equal, or reversed). Honest: 2D geometric toy; this is STERIC complementarity (short-range),
a SIGNATURE analog of dipoles, not a long-range magnetic field.

RESULT: HALF the dipole signature holds, half does not. Inverse meshing binds much deeper
(-260, gap 2.26) than identical clashing (-75, gap 2.79); flat control intermediate (-196).
So orientation-dependence EMERGES from geometry + an isotropic law (not built in): complementary
attracts MORE, like-aligned attracts LESS. BUT this is DIFFERENTIAL ATTRACTION -- identical still
binds (-75), it does not REPEL. A characterization sweep (longer teeth / harder core) does NOT
cleanly produce repulsion: the "repulsive" cases (identical Emin 1e8..1e22) are the rigid hard-core
SINGULARITY exploding when long rigid teeth are forced to overlap -- an artifact, not dipole
repulsion (at extreme amp even INVERSE goes positive). VERDICT: rigid combs give differential
attraction (the "opposite attracts more" half) but cannot give clean like-pole REPULSION; smooth
repulsion would need DEFORMABLE surfaces (the dynamic beating substrate), not a static rigid scan.
Plus the standing caveat: steric/short-range, not the long-range 1/r^3 magnetic field.
