"""
BSF Stage 86 (user invitation: attack the K/gamma anchor - the autonomous flow K->K* named in S85). The flow
EXISTS: it is the Kosterlitz-Thouless flow the substrate already sits in (S31 eta=1/4, S33 universal jump).
[1] The KT RG flow (u=1/K, du/dl=4pi^3 y^2, dy/dl=(2-pi/u)y) has a UNIVERSAL fixed point K*=2/pi. Approaching
    criticality from the ordered side, the renormalised stiffness K_R -> 2/pi from above (K_R=0.767 far from
    Tc; 0.647, 0.644 near Tc); the disordered side runs away (vortex unbinding). The fixed point and flow
    coefficients (4pi^3, eigenvalue 2-piK) are FORCED universals. So the autonomous K->K* flow S85 asked for
    exists and FORCES the closure/feedback coefficient to the universal jump 2/pi - gamma/K is NOT a free
    anchor. The recursion terminates at a FORCED invariant (the user's refusal of 'gamma free' is vindicated).
[2] But a FORCED K*=2/pi is O(1): t*=sqrt(y_t/K*)=0.627 (O(1)) -> NO hierarchy. Confirms S82: a forced O(1)
    invariant fixes the coefficient but generates no hierarchy.
[3] The observed 10^19/10^-31 hierarchy lives NOT in K* but in the OFF-critical datum (the bare fugacity / how
    far above the transition one starts), which the fixed point does not fix (S80).
VERDICT: does NOT finish the theory, but CLOSES the recursion at a forced invariant. Every coefficient is now
forced (KT universals); the ontology is unified; the SINGLE remaining free number is the bare off-critical
coupling = the hierarchy = the hierarchy/CC problem unsolved by ALL physics. The framework is CLOSED up to
(i) one off-critical datum and (ii) the meta-axiomatic wall. Not a finished theory - a fully MAPPED one:
nothing qualitative unaccounted, every coefficient forced, the one free number identified as the universal
open problem. Honest summit of the magnitudes arc (S77->S86).
